'The apex court also expressed annoyance over the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) not filing an action plan and report on steps taken on the suggestions given by Delhi Commissioner of Police Rakesh Asthana.' + '\n'

+

'The top court was informed by Delhi Police that it has registered an FIR under various sections of Prevention of Corruption Act and IPC against 37 persons with regard to collusion with realty firm Unitech’s imprisoned ex-promoters Sanjay and Ajay Chandra.' + '\n'

'The Enforcement Directorate had made a startling revelation recently that it had unearthed a “secret underground office” here which was being operated by erstwhile Unitech founder Ramesh Chandra and visited by his sons Sanjay and Ajay when on parole or bail.' + '\n' 


+

'Both Sanjay and Ajay who are in jail since August 2017 are accused of allegedly siphoning home buyers’ money.' + '\n' +

'It is a sorry state of affairs in Tihar Jail. We have read in newspapers two-three days back that murder is happening in the jail. It has become a den for criminals. The concerned secretary in MHA should file an action plan and a report on steps taken so far on the suggestions given by Delhi Commissioner of Police Rakesh Asthana within three weeks,” the bench said.' + '\n' +
